## Task 2

I was watching an old episode of Mad Men yersterday, in which a character was demonsstrating a new machine for cutting grass and accidentally `❓drove over` a client's foot!
It made me thindk: wath's the worst mistake you've made at work?

Dejan
I worked for a building company for several yars and one time I was repairing the bathroom in a flat while the family was away.
At the end of the day, I was checking the bath to see if the repair was good when I got a call from a friend.
He had a `❓spare` ticket for a big game that night and I had to go `❓straightway` if I wanted it.
I was so `❓excited`, I `❓rushed out` and completely forgot about the bath.
That night it completely flooded the flat and athe water went through the ceiling to the flat below.
There was quite a lot of damage and I ended up paying for it!

Veronica
One time I was working in a restaurant as a waitress.
I was carrying a heavy `❓tray` of food and drinks to a table and for some reason I was quire nervous.
As I got close to the table, I `❓tripped over` a bag on the floor.
The drinks on mhy tray split all over the people at the table!
It was so `❓embarrasing`.
They got really wet and were very `❓cross`!

Maxim
I work for quite a big company in the IT department.
One day I ahd to access a computer in a local office, so I sent out a message for the user of the computer to call me, but someehow I mangaged to send the message to every computyer in the whole company - all 6000 of them!
I guess I must've checked the wrong box on the system of forgotten to uncheck one.
Anyway, we were getting calls to our office for days!
