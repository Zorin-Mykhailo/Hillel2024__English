> *Read the text about  detective Harper and pay attention to underlined words.* 

**STORY TIME**

Late at night, Detective Harper found herself standing in front of the old mansion that had long been rumored[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "rumor [румерд] — за чутками, пліткували 🌐 The house is rumored to be haunted. 🛠️ adjective (past participle of 'rumor')") to be haunted[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "haunt [хонтід] — населений привидами, переслідуваний 🌐 They say the old mansion is haunted by spirits. 🛠️ adjective"). As she cautiously entered the dimly lit foyer, strange sounds echoed through the house.  

"This place <ins>must</ins> have a history filled with secrets." She felt an uneasy presence, and her instincts told her that something significant <ins>must</ins> have happened here.  

As she explored further, Detective Harper stumbled[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "stumble [стамблд] — спіткнувся, натрапив 🌐 He stumbled on a rock while walking in the dark. 🛠️ verb (past tense of 'stumble')") upon[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "upon [апон] — на, після, з моменту 🌐 Upon entering the room, she felt a sudden chill. 🛠️ preposition") a hidden door concealed[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "conceal [консі́лд] — прихований, замаскований 🌐 The door was concealed behind a curtain. 🛠️ adjective (past participle of 'conceal')") behind a bookshelf. "This <ins>may</ins> lead to the heart of the mystery." With a deep breath, she pushed the door open, revealing a secret passage that seemed to wind its way beneath the mansion.  

In the underground chambers, she discovered old journals and faded photographs. Clues that hinted at a hidden treasure or a long-lost family secret. Detective Harper knew she <ins>might</ins> be on the brink of uncovering a story that had been buried for decades.  

In the dim light, she found a locked chest that can hold the key to the mansion's enigma. "This <ins>must</ins> be the final piece of the puzzle," she thought. With a sense of anticipation, Detective Harper opened that chest, revealing[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "reveal [ріві́лінг] — викривальний, що показує; відвертий 🌐 Her expression was quite revealing of her true feelings. 🛠️ adjective") a collection of letters that revealed a tale of love, betrayal, and a fortune lost to time.  

As she pieced together the fragments of the past, Detective Harper realized that this mansion, which once seemed haunted, was actually haunted by the weight of its own secrets. The mysteries hidden within its walls unfolded[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "unfold [анфо́лдед] — розгорнувся, відкрився 🌐 A surprising story unfolded before our eyes. 🛠️ verb (past tense of 'unfold')") like a carefully crafted story, and she knew she had uncovered a truth that <ins>might</ins> change the way the world saw this mysterious place forever.

### 4C Rules. Modals of deduction in the present

**Modals of Deduction in the present**  
We can use modal verbs for deduction – guessing if something is true using the available information. The modal verb we choose shows **how certain** we are about the possibility.  

a).  We use `must` when we feel <ins>sure</ins> that something is true or it's the only realistic possibility.

> *This must be her house. I can see her car in the garage.*  
> *He must live near here because he always walks to work.*  

b). We use `might`, `may` or `could` to say that we think something is <ins>possible</ins> but we're not sure. 

> *She's not here yet. She might be stuck in traffic.*  
> *He's not answering. He could be in class.*

c). We use `can't` when we feel <ins>sure</ins> that something is <ins>not possible</ins>.

> *It can't be far now. We've been driving for hours.*  
> *She can't know about the complaint. She's promoted him to team leader.*
