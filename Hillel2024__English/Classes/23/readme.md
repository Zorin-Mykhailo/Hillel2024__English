## Task 1. Discuss
```
Look at the photos and answer the questions.

1 What inventions or developments do the pictures show?
2 How do you think they can benefit people?
```

## Task 2. Reading
### Task 2A
```
Read the article and sum up each paragraph with 1 sentence. 
```

**Communication**  
In the near future, we may ne able to cummunicate in any language we choose. A number of companies are working on translating machines that use the voice frequencies of the speaker. This makes it sound as though the user is speaking the foreigh language. We already have translating machines, but they are slow and inaccurate and they sound like robots. In only a year or two this new machine, which will be a headset, could come onto the market and allow us to speak every language under the sun.  

**Entertainment**  
Full immersion virtual reality will be with us in perhaps ten to twenty years' time. We will be able to plant tiny microchips in the brain, allowing a person to experience games, movies, and virtual life as if they are real. As computers interact with the brain, we will have the sensation of touching, seeing, hearing, and smelling virtual objects in virtual worlds. Instead of just watching heroes in movies, signals to the brain will let us feel what our heroes feel, see what ther see. Furtunately, if things get too terrifying, we will be able to switch it off with the push of a button!  

**Health**  
The future of health is going to be a tale of big and small. Tiny nano monitors will be placed inside our bodies, and these will produce Big Datea - enormous amounts of information - that allow is to check our health and help us predict illnesses. Another big development probably won't be ready in the short term, but in the long term ghere is hope that 3D printers will make copies of body parts such as hearts, livers and kidneys. If it happens, this is likely to save millions of lives. Using 3D Priners, we can already  make copies of plastic and metal objects. The next step is to copy living tissue.  

**Global problems**  
In the next thirty years, climate change is going to seriously affect traditional farming. Floods and droughts will disrupt farming patterns that have exsted for thousands of years. Because of this, cities will have to start producing food, and vertical farming will become common. Tower blocks and skyscrapers will have gardens built into them. Each floor will grow different plants, fruits and vegetables, and the water will be recycled. Instead of stretching out fgor miles across the landscape, farmland will now rise hundreds of meters into the air.  

---

## Task 2B
```
Complete the summary of the article with words from the text.
Use one word in each gap.
```

The writer believes a machine will be able to `translate` our words into different languages. She thinks we'll use monitors in our `bodies`
to check our health, and 3D printers will make perfect `copies` of human organs like the heart. We will entertain ourselves
with virtual reality, as computers learn to interact with the `brain`. The problems caused by `climate` change will mean vertical farming becomes popular.

---

### Task 2C
```
Discuss with your group.
```

1. Which ideas are already coming into life?

2. Which ideas don't you like? Why not?

3. Which ideas in the article do you like? Can you think of other uses for these inventions?

---

## Task 3. Vocabulary. Time markers. 
```
Read sentences 1-6 from the article and identify the time markers.
```

1. `In the near future`, we may be able to communicate in any language we choose.  
2. `In only a year or two` the machine, which will be a headset, could come onto the market ...  
3. Another big development probably won't be ready `in the short term`,  
4. ... `in the long term` there is hope that 3D printers wil make copies of body parts ...  
5. Full immersion virtual reality wil be with us `in perhaps ten to twenty years'` time.  
6. `In the next thirty years`, climate change is going to seriously affect traditional farming.  

---

## Task 4.
```
Group the following time markers.
```

| **Soon** | **Date or time period**| **In a long time** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| int he near future| in the next 30 years' time| in the long term |
| in the sort term | in perhaps 10 t0 20 yeears | in the long term |
|| in a year or two||

---

## Task 5. Speaking

```
work in pairs. Ask and answer the questions using both the time markers given.
```

1. Will you still live in the same place: `a) in the near future?` `b) in ten years' time?`  
2. What projects wil you work on: `a) in the short term?` `b) in the long term?`  
3. Will your working life/life as a student change: `a) in the next five to ten years?` `b) in a year or two?`  

---

## Task 6. Grammar. Predictions 

### 6A
```
Read the extracts from the article. Are predictions certain  (C) or possible (P)?
```

| Prediction | Certain | Possible |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| We <u>may</u> be able to communicate in any language we choose. |||
| In only a year or two, the headset <u>could</u> come onto the market. |||
| This <u>is likely</u> to save millions of lives. |||
| Climate change <u>is going to</u> seriously affect traditional farming. |||
| Tower blocks and skyscrapers <u>will</u> have gardens. |||

---

### 6B
```
Look at the underlined words above. Complete the rules with will, could, to or be.
```

1. We use `will + infinitive` without `to` to make predictions about the future.  
2. We use `be going to +infinitive` without `to`  make predictions when there is present evidence.  
3. We use `may` or `could +infinitive` without `to` to say something is possible but not certain.  
4. We use `be likely + infinitive` with `to` say something will probably happen.  

---

### 6C
```
Make up sentences.
```

Monday / tomorrow  
Team / win  
not come / party  
flight / delay / bad weather  
people / online / time
