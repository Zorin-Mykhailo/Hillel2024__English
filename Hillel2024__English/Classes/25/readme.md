Video: [$600 for DIRTY Sneakers? Golden Goose Review](https://youtu.be/RhtgCJRR1To)

> Why would someone pay 600 for a dirty pair of [sneakers](# "кросівки")?  
> Like many other brands I review here it was the first time I heard of Golden Goose.  
> After doing some research I got a pair and asked my wife, can you try this one for me?  
> Her first reaction was why would you want me to wear used pair of shoes?  
> I [burst into](# "раптом почати щось, увірватися") laughter totally understanding her reaction because I would have said the same thing.  
> If it was my grandpa [though](# "хоча, проте, однак") he would [be chasing](# "переслідувати, гнатися") me with a stick for spending so much on a [lousy](# "паршивий, жахливий") pair of shoes.  
> After my wife wear these for a few hours she actually said they were really comfortable, and she's not easily impressed.  
> Now, here's [my take](# "моя думка, моя точка зору") on them.  
> At [first glance](# "перший погляд"), the packaging is well done. 
> A little too much for sneakers in my opinion. 
> Overflowing with marketing, in my experience when there's too much marketing you are definitely paying for it.  
> At first look, I think the [leather](# "шкіра (матеріал)") looks pretty good.  
> It's a minimally finished [cowhide](# "коров'яча шкіра") full [grain](# "зерно, текстура, структура") in my opinion before they [harshed it up](# "зіпсував, зробив грубішим").  
> It's a pretty nice leather choice from the first feel, and the engineering the things inside little [towelish](# "схожий на рушник, рушникоподібний") things probably to absorb moisture in your feet, and the [stitch](# "шов, стібок; зшивати") lines.  
> Everything looks pretty good well crafted shoe, but we're gonna see a lot more details once we open this up.  
> From the upward leather, a good pigment finish [came up](# "з'явився, підійшов, виник") very typical for shoes.  
> It's nice leather choice, definitely throughout the [suede](# "замша") accents they're all good, the little other silver color on the [heel](# "п'ята, каблук") is good as well.  
> The similar leather in the top of the inner [sole](# "підошва, єдиний") is also nice.  
> So, leather choice is not bad at all.  
> Very typical but it's not [spectacular](# "вражаючий, захопливий") or extremely special for the price of the shoe.  
> There's quite a bit of [thoughtful](# "задумливий, уважний, турботливий") engineered pieces inside like this towel looking thing probably to absorb the moisture, a lot of sponges to give that cushiony look, and a lot of people in my research mention the comfort of these shoes probably that's one of the biggest points that makes the shoe a little different than others in my opinion.  
> The only part that kind of [disappointed](# "розчарований") me was this sides that looks like leather is not actually leather, it's a PU fake leather material.  
> Probably they made that decision from a [durability](# "міцність, довговічність") [standpoint](# "точка зору, позиція") since this is going to get kicked around, and that might be a more durable material they choose here.  
> [Overall](# "загалом, в цілому"), very well constructed shoe.  
> It was very hard to open, very nice glues engineering internal support materials made with attention to detail, made for comfort, engineered for durability.  
> Definitely I can see that when I'm opening this shoe.  
> Leathers are good as well, it's made in Italy, that's a big plus in my eye as well.  
> But let's be honest $545 is a really high price even for a shoe of this caliber.  
> They managed to catch the attention of [affluent](# "заможний, багатий") customers who set the trends by making something different and expensive and yes if you make something different and lower price it, it's not going to work.  
> If you make something [subtle](# "тонкий, витончений, ледь помітний") and make it expensive it's not going to work again.  
> So this is the perfect formula to catch the attention of [trendsetters](# "законодавці моди, ті, хто задають тренди") and then become a big topic in today's market.  
> It's a delicate dance of offering something special yet overpriced to catch the eye of the trendsetters and this is exactly what's happening with the Golden Goose.  
> Their [rebellious](# "бунтівний, непокірний") philosophy aligns really well with the gen Z era, but I think their marketing takes it a little bit too far.  
> In my opinion, it misses the point because I believe dreaming is freedom and it is a state of being, and you don't need to spend six hundred dollars to wave a flag of it.  
> When I was doing the research about the customer reviews of the brand I found an article where the guy says it's Italian leather it's a lot more expensive than other leathers, and it takes longer to produce.  
> Well, it's wrong. 
> Yes, Italian leathers are usually a bit more expensive than rest of the world, but in a pair of shoes probably difference wouldn't be more than ten dollars, and it doesn't take longer to make unless we're talking about exclusively vegetable [tan](# "засмага; дублення; жовтувато-коричневий колір") specialty letters, and this is not the case here.  
> They're very typical leathers made in Italy, they're definitely good quality on a well-constructed shoe.  
> But, the [perception](# "сприйняття, усвідомлення") of that expensiveness and taking longer parts coming from the exactly overpricing strategy of the brand because when you price something high people think everything you use is special expensive and takes longer to produce.  
> Finally, it is a nice trendy piece of shoes.    
> Does it worth the price tag for a person like me who doesn't care about trends?  
> Not really, but if you're into it why not?
