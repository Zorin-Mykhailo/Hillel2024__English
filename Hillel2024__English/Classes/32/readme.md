## Lexical note. SHALL
*Study the following lexical note.*

<u>The usage of SHALL</u>

<u>Shall</u> is a modal verb that is not as common in modern English as other modals like will or must. However, it is still used in some specific situations:

`Suggestions or Offers`  
We use <u>shall</u> to make suggestions or polite offers, especially in formal English.
> ***Examples:***  
> Shall we go for a walk? (Suggestion)  
> Shall I help you with your homework? (Offer)  

`Formal or Legal Language`  
<u>Shall</u> is often found in official or legal documents to express obligation or rules. It has the same meaning as <u>must</u>.
> ***Examples:***  
> The tenant shall pay rent by the 5th of each month.  
> Participants shall not share confidential information.  

`Future Actions (Formal)`  
In British English, <u>shall</u> can replace <u>will</u> in formal contexts to talk about the future, especially with <u>I</u> or <u>we</u>.  
> ***Examples:***  
> I shall see you at the meeting tomorrow.  
> We shall overcome these challenges.
