### 3B. Read the text and make up the name of the paragraphs.

Most Popular Gossip Themes  
Find out what we love to gossip about and why

1. `Why we gossip about money`  
Why do we love hearing salary rumours and trying to find out how much our neighbour paid for his new car? Because money is an easy way to compare yourself with other people. Tracking how people spend money is our way of checking their social status by discussing how wealthy or poor they are.

2. `Why Love and Relationships Are a Gossip Magnet`  
Love and relationships are things we all have in common. It puts everyone on a level playing field because we all experienced similar things. So when we gossip about a friend’s marriage and dating life, on some level we can relate—either because we've been there too, or we hope we never are. Moreover, love life tells a lot about a person and how reliable they are.

3. `Gossips About Personalities and Trust`  
Ever notice how often you talk about people's personalities? Are they nice or no? We always talk about what people are like. With good reason: "We gossip about reputation to find out whom to deal with and whom to avoid." We’re very sensitive about betrayal, especially by someone we thought we could trust. So we're always trying to see what the person is before dealing with them.

4. `Why We Gossip About Celebrities`  
From Us Weekly to TM Z, getting the latest news on Tiger Woods or Brangelina is easier than ever. But why do we care? The reasons are endless: we need to forget about daily life, we want to have what they have and to be celebrities as well. It's hard not to be jealous of their lifestyles, so often when we gossip about celebrities it means that we’re not happy and hope they’re miserable too.


### 3C. Read the article again and answer the questions.


1. What can we learn about people when we know how much money they have or spend?
```
We can learn about their social status, lifestyle, and financial priorities. It helps us understand how wealthy or poor they are and how they manage their resources.
```

2. What does the author mean by saying "it puts everyone on a level playing field"?
```
The author means that love and relationships are universal experiences. Regardless of wealth or status, everyone can relate to these aspects of life, as they are common to all.
```

Why is it important for people to avoid unreliable people?
```
Unreliable people can betray trust, cause problems, or create unnecessary stress. Gossiping about someone's reputation helps others decide whom to trust and whom to avoid in order to protect themselves.
```

Why do we want celebrities to be unhappy?
```
This often stems from jealousy. When we see their luxurious lifestyles, we may feel dissatisfied with our own lives. Gossiping about their unhappiness can make us feel better about our situation by believing that they are not as perfect as they seem.
```
