## Task 3. Reading
> [!NOTE]  
> *Read about the following situation. Was the conductor right? What else could have been done in that situation?*  

Conductor throws out audience member whose phone went off

At the national Music Auditorium in Madrid, Wednesday's performance on Hadnel's Messiah was interrupted by a mobile phone going off in a row close to the stage, during the aria He was despised. Conductor William Chrstie stopped the performance, turned, pointed at the phone owner, and shouted, "Out! You have just ruined one of the most beautiful passages of one of the most beautiful works ever written." The phone owner got up and quickly left the hall.

## Task 4 Opinions
> [!NOTE]  
> *Do you agree or disagree with the opinions?* 

Opinion 1.  
I think all concert halls should block mobile phone reception. Reception should be available until right before the concert begins, during the interval and immediately after it finishes.  

Opinion 2.  
I think the conductor did the right thing. People come to concerts to enjoy the music and have a special experience, not to be distracted by someone's phone. It's a matter of respect for the performers and the audience. If you can't follow basic rules, you shouldn't stay.  

Opinion 3.  
While I understand the conductor's frustration, it might have been a bit harsh to stop the performance and call the person out in front of everyone. Mistakes happen, and some people genuinely forget to silence their phones. Maybe a polite reminder at the beginning of the concert would help prevent such situations.  

Opinion 4.  
Honestly, the conductor overreacted. The person probably felt embarrassed enough without being singled out in front of everyone. A short pause and a general reminder to silence phones would have been enough. Public shaming seems unnecessary in this case.

## Task 5.

> *Look at the photos and read the text.*

a). Do you know people who do it? Do you ever do it?
