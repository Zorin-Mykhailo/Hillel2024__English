# 📕 Home assignment 13

## Task 1

Put the lines of the dialogue in the correct order.

`I can't decide how to go on vacation this year. Should we take the hovercraft or the ferry? (Joking)`  
`Well, which one do you think would be more fun?`  
`I'm not sure. The hovercraft might be a cool experience but I heard that it's quite loud and bumpy.`  
`Yeah, true. Maybe we should stick with the classic cruise ship option. We could relax and enjoy the journey.`  
`That sounds good to me. But then we'll have to deal with seasickness. Plus, what if there's bad weather and our trip gets delayed?`  
`Okay, maybe it is better to fly then. How about taking an aircraft to our destination?`  
`I'm not afraid of flying, but I hate being stuck in a cramped space for hours. What about taking a coach instead?`  
`Hmm, that might actually work. It'll stop at multiple locations so we can stretch our legs along the way. And we won't have to worry about fitting our luggage in the overhead compartment.`  
`Yeah, plus we can sit together and chat. I'll just check online for tickets.`  
`Actually, let's take my car. We can fill up with petrol before leaving and listen to music while driving.`  
`Sounds like a plan.`
