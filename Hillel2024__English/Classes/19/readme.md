## Task 2. 
Work in pairs. Do you think space programmes, which cost millions, are a good way for governments to spend money? Give reasons.

For Space Programmes:
- Scientific Discovery – They help us understand the universe, planets, and our own Earth better.
- Technological Progress – Many everyday technologies (GPS, weather forecasting) come from space research.
- Inspiration & Education – Space exploration encourages young people to study science and engineering.
- Future Survival – It prepares us for potential threats, like asteroids, and opens the door for colonizing other planets.

Against Space Programmes:
- High Cost – Governments spend billions while there are urgent problems like poverty and healthcare.
- Earth's Issues First – Money could be better used to solve climate change, hunger, or social issues.
- Risk & Uncertainty – Many missions fail, and returns on investment are not immediate.

## Task 3. Reading and Grammar. Participle clauses 
### 3A.
Task 1. Read part 1of the article. How would you have felt if you had been one of the Apollo 13 astronauts?
Task 2. Read part 2of the article. The Apolo 13 mission has been described as a 'successful failure'. Why?

PART 1
Apollo 13, `launched from Florida on 11 April 1970`, wat the third Apollo mission `designed to land on the moon`. The three astronauts `chosen for the mission` were James Lovell, Rred Haise and John Swigert. The launch, `watched by millions on TV`, went smoothly and for the first two days in space, everything went well, The crew gave a 49-minute TV `interview explaining how they lived and worked in zero gravity`. However, nine minutes after the interview finished, a tank `containing oxygen` exploded and John Swigert, `noticing a red warning light`, said the famous words: "Houston, we've had a problem here." They checked all their equipment and realised that they were running out of water, power and oxygen - and fast. They were in a damaged spaceship `floating 320 000 kilometres from EArth`.

PART 2
The astronauts left the main part of the spaceship and went inside the lunar module, `which had been fitted with its own oxygen tank`. But inside the smaller nodule, `which was designed to hold only two people`, carbon dioxide levels started rising. The astronauts, `who had been following instructions from the ground crew`, made special filters out of plastic bags and cardboard, Then they waited in the cold and dark while the groud crew, `who were working 24 hours a day`, tried to work out a way to bring them home. If some people in America were losing interest in the Space Program, the Apollo 13 crisis, `which was discused on all the TV news programmes`, changed all thatt. The astronauts `who were risking their lives` and the people `who were trying to save them` all became national heroes - especiallly when Apollo 13 returned safely to Earth with all three astronauts alive.

### 3B Rules. Participle clauses
LEARN THIS! Participle clauses

a) We use **participle clauses (дієприкметрик)** to give more information about a noun. **Participial clauses** are also frequently heard in radio and TV news broadcasts (as well as newspaper articles and reports). It's possible to say the same thing as a **relative clause**, starting with who, which or that, but with fewer words.
e.g.: 
*There were two men sitting on the bench.(= who were sitting on the bench)*
 
b) **Participle clauses** can begin with a present participle (-ing form). The participle  replaces an active verb of any tense, including state verbs.
e.g.: 
*I saw a man wearing (= who was wearing) a space suit*
*Students needing (=who need) a lift should wait here.*

c) Participle clauses can also begin with a past participle. The participle replaces a passive verb of any tense.
e.g.:
*We lived in a large house, built  (=which had been built) in the 17th century.* 

`Note` that when we are talking about a single completed action in a defining relative clause, we cannot use present participle.
e.g.: 
*The girl **who fell down the cliff** broke her leg.*
*(NOT: The girl falling down cliff…)*

> ***Callum***        
> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.
> 
> ***Catherine***  
> And me, Catherine.
> 
> ***Callum***        
> Today we’re focussing on **participle clauses**.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> Yes, that’s clauses that begin with **present** or **past participles**.
> 
> ***Callum***        
> We’ll find out what they are and how to use them.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> And there’ll be lots of examples and also a quiz. Before we start though Callum, are you all right?
> 
> ***Callum***
> What do you mean?
> 
> ***Catherine***
> Well you’ve got little bits of tissue stuck on your face.
> 
> ***Callum***
> Oh that, you noticed.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> Well, it’s hard to miss them really.
> 
> ***Callum***
> I cut myself **shaving**.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> I see, that’s convenient.
> 
> ***Callum***
> Not really, it hurt.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> But it did give you a perfect example of **a present participle clause**, which is today’s topic.
> 
> ***Callum***
> Yes it did! Let’s use that then as our first example. I cut myself **shaving**. First though, let’s remind everyone what a present participle is:
> 
> ***Catherine***
> Sure. The present participle is **the -ing form** of the verb. We use it to form the continuous verb forms. So if the infinitive is shave, the **present participle** is **shaving**.
> 
> ***Callum***
> The past continuous of shave is: “I was **shaving**.”
> 
> ***Catherine***
> And something happened while you were **shaving**, Callum
> 
> ***Callum***
> Yes, I cut myself.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> You did. Now we can make a number of different sentences with this information. You could say:
> 
> ***Callum***
> I was **shaving** and I cut myself or: While I was **shaving** I cut myself.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> Let’s just swap those clauses around
> 
> ***Callum***
> I cut myself while I was **shaving**.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> OK, now because the subject of each of those clauses is the same - you - we can make the sentence more efficient and sound more natural by not repeating > the pronoun and auxiliary that goes with it.
> 
> ***Callum***
> I cut myself while **shaving**.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> This is fine, but we can also leave out the conjunction – while. Which leaves us with:
> 
> ***Callum***
> I cut myself **shaving**. 
> 
> ***Catherine***
> So we can use this structure when two things happen at the same time.
>  
> ***Callum***
> Yes, lets have some more examples. Catherine, what were you doing last night?
> 
> ***Catherine***
> I was **sitting** on the sofa. I was **watching** TV. So I can say: I was **sitting** on the sofa **watching** TV. Callum: What are we doing now?
> 
> ***Callum***
> We are in the studio. We are **recording** 6 Minute Grammar. We’re in the studio **recording** 6 Minute Grammar.
> 
> STING
> 
> ***Catherine***
> Today we’re talking about *participle clauses*.
> 
> ***Callum***
> We’ve looked at one way you can use a **present participle clause**; now let’s look at a **past participle clause**. First Catherine, let’s review what **a past participle** is.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> It’s the third form of the verb, so if you remember go, went, gone, or do, did, done; gone and done are the **past participles**. For regular verbs this is **the -ed form**. We use the **past participle** in perfect verb forms and also the passive.
> 
> ***Callum***
> So how would we use a **past participle clause**?
> 
> ***Catherine***
> Like **present participle clauses**, it’s a way of being more economical with language and avoiding repetition. Listen to these sentences.
> 
> Neil
> The dog was **hit** by the car. It wasn’t hurt.
> The dog that was **hit** by the car wasn’t hurt.
> The dog **hit** by the car wasn’t hurt.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> So we started there with two sentences. Both contained clauses that had the same subject. We have **the dog** in the first sentence, and in the second it’s referred to with the pronoun **it**.
> 
> Neil
> The dog **was hit** by a car. It wasn’t hurt.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> We can the combine these into one sentence by using a relative clause.
> 
> Neil
> The dog **that was hit** by the car wasn’t hurt.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> And we can further shorten this by leaving out the relative pronoun and the auxiliary that goes with it. This leaves us with:
> 
> Neil
> The dog **hit** by the car wasn’t hurt.
> 
> ***Callum***
> So effectively what we do is combine all the bits that identify the subject into one phrase.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> Yes, it’s **like a reduced relative clause** that becomes the subject of the sentence. You can see this form quite regularly in warning notices in public > places.
> 
> Neil
> Cars **parked** here will be clamped.
> Bicycles **chained** to this fence will be removed.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> Cars **parked** here is a shortened version of: Cars **which are parked** here…
> 
> ***Callum***
> And bicycles **chained** here is a shortened version of: Bicycles **which are chained** here.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> That’s right.
> 
> STING
> 
> ***Callum***
> And now: quiz time. Join the two sentences together into one. Here’s number one:
> 
> ***Catherine***
> I saw the cat. It was playing with a mouse.
> I saw the cat. It was playing with a mouse.
> 
> ***Callum***
> And the answer is: I saw the cat playing with a mouse. Number two:
> 
> ***Catherine***
> The gold was stolen from the bank. It was never found.
> The gold was stolen from the bank. It was never found.
> 
> ***Callum***
> The answer is: The gold stolen from the bank was never found. And finally number three.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> She made a lot of money. She was running her own company.
> She made a lot of money. She was running her own company.
> 
> ***Callum***
> And the answer is: She made a lot of money running her own company. Well done if you got them all right.
> 
> ***Catherine***
> And that’s all from us for this programme. There’s more about this topic on our website.
> 
> ***Callum***
> Do join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.
