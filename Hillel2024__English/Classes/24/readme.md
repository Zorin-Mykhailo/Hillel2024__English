> **Student A:** I’m alive and kicking, thanks! My week’s been busy too, but so far so good.  

Dialogue 2. 
Two friends are talking after one of them recently moved to a new house. At first, the friend says they’re fine, but with encouragement, they open up.

> Student A: So, how’s the new house?  
> Student B: It’s fine. The rooms are big, and there’s a lovely kitchen with plenty of natural light. But honestly, the move has been a stressful process. I’m still unpacking and trying to settle in.  
> Student A: That sounds rough at first, but I’m sure things will come to fruition soon. Did you manage to set up your garden like you planned?  
> Student B: Actually, yes! I even started a small herb garden, and it feels like a little victory. It’s making me feel more at home, and I’m hopeful that with time, I’ll be in a better state overall—even if the first week was challenging.  


Dialogue 3.  
One student has had a recent disagreement with another friend, and they seem quiet. Their friend notices and checks in.

> Student A: Hey, you’ve been really quiet today. Everything okay?  
> Student B: Yeah, I’m fine.  
> Student A: Really? You seem off. Is it because you fell out with someone recently?  
> Student B: Well, yes. I had a disagreement with a close friend, and it’s been pretty stressful. I felt so disappointed—almost like all the efforts I’ve put into our friendship were wasted. I’m still processing it, but I’m grateful for a few honest conversations that might help us patch things up.  
> Student A: I understand. It’s hard when emotions run high. Just remember, I’m here if you want to talk or need some support.  


Dialogue 4.  
Juicy gossip

> Student A: Did you hear the latest about Karen in accounting? She just got promoted to manager, but…  
> Student B: …but rumor has it that her promotion wasn’t entirely by merit. Apparently, she’s been quite bossy and has been trash talking some colleagues behind their backs. Some people even say her style is harsh, which has made a few of them jealous.  
> Student A: Wow, that’s wild! It seems like office politics can be as gossipy as any high school drama.  

Dialogue 5.  
Juicy gossip.

> Student A: So, my friend just got a new neighbor who moved in next door, and no one knows anything about…  
> Student B: …about who they really are. I heard some neighbors whisper that the newcomer might have recently split up with someone and now lives apart from each other. There’s even talk of a scandalous past—some are saying it’s all just trash talking, but others are quite curious.  
> Student A: That’s definitely intriguing. It’ll be interesting to see if more details emerge or if it just remains a mystery.
