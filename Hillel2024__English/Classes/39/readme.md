1). How much money do you think people spend living in these cities?

> 
> B. New York, US – One of the most expensive cities in the world! Rent, transport, and food are very costly. It could be around $4000-6000 per month for an average lifestyle.
>
> C. Mumbai, India – There’s a huge gap between rich areas and slums. On average, people might spend $500-1500 per month, but in luxury areas, it can be much higher.

>  
> Mumbai:  
> • Housing (especially in central areas), education, transport.  
> • Spending depends on income level — in slums, it’s basic needs; in rich areas, it’s luxury goods and services.
