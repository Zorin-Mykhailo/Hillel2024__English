## Task 2. Vocabulary
> [!NOTE]  
> *Read a paragraph below and answer a few questions afterwards.*  

I often struggle with saying "no" because I worry that it might seem **selfish[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "selfish [се́лфіш] — егоїстичний 🌐 It was selfish of him to take all the credit. 🛠️ adjective")**. It's become a **habit[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "habit [ге́біт] — звичка 🌐 Waking up early has become a habit for me. 🛠️ noun")** to always say "yes" to requests, even when I have a lot of things to do. Sometimes, I need to **step aside[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "step aside [степ еса́йд] — відійти вбік; поступитися місцем 🌐 He decided to step aside and let someone else take the lead. 🛠️ phrasal verb")** and think about my own needs. When someone asks for a favour, I find it challenging to **get back[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "get back [ґет бек] — повернутись, зв'язатися знову 🌐 I’ll get back to you later with an answer. 🛠️ phrasal verb")** to them with a "no". I feel like I need an **excuse[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "excuse [ікскью́з] — виправдання, привід; вибачати 🌐 He gave a weak excuse for being late. 🛠️ noun, verb")** to say "no", because I fear that their feelings will be **crushed[<sup>🌐</sup>](# "crush [крашд] — розбитий емоційно; роздавлений 🌐 She felt crushed after hearing the bad news. 🛠️ adjective (past participle)")**.
1. What can you recommend the person?
2. DEFINE all the words in the paragraph. Use an academic English dictionary if needed. (dictionary)
3.  Can you relate to the opinion in the paragraph? Do you often feel the same?

> I would recommend practicing setting healthy boundaries by learning that saying “no” isn’t selfish — it’s a way to protect your time, energy, and well-being. You can start with polite refusals like, “I’d love to help, but I’m currently at capacity.” Also, remind yourself that saying "no" doesn't require a detailed excuse — being honest and respectful is enough.

## Task 3. Video

### 1) Video  

[🎥 Here is why you should learn to say no](https://youtu.be/tsaNcxkmkuI)

So often, we all want to be liked — and that's a natural thing. We say, "I want other people to like me." But sometimes people take that too far and start saying "yes" to everything they're asked, because it feels good on one hand to say "yes". But on the other hand, every time you say "yes" to something, you're really saying no to something else you could be doing with your time.

I work with a lot of people who say, "Well, I don't want to be selfish." But really, when you say "yes" to everything, it becomes about me — "I want to feel good" or "I want people to like me more" — and that, in itself, can actually be selfish.

A lot of times, saying "yes" just becomes a habit. People automatically say "yes" without even thinking about the question or whether it's something they truly want to do. A good trick is to set a default response like, "Thanks for asking, I'll think about it and get back to you," or something similar. This gives you a chance to step aside and really consider: Is this something I want to do or not?

And remember — you don’t always have to give a reason for saying "no". It's okay to simply say, "No, thanks for asking, but I can’t do that." You don’t necessarily need an excuse.

When people say "yes" to everything, it might help to treat it like an experiment: say "no" to someone and see what happens. Do they truly dislike you afterward? Are they completely crushed because you didn't do what they wanted? Most of the time, you'll find that people are much more accepting of a "no" than you gave yourself credit for. And over time, it becomes easier to say "no" to bigger things.

## 2) Questions

1). What are two reasons why people don’t say "no"?  
> • People want to be liked and accepted by others.

2). What are the tricks the speakers gives that can help people say "no"?  
> • Use a default response like: "Thanks for asking, I’ll think about it and get back to you."  
> • Remind yourself that you don’t always need an excuse to say no — it's okay to just say "no, thanks".  
> • Treat saying "no" as an experiment: try it and see that people usually accept it better than you expect.  

3). How do you feel when other people say "no" to you? Do you feel crushed or are you accepting?  
> Answer will vary — here's a sample:
> I usually understand when people say "no". As long as they're respectful, I don't feel crushed. I accept that everyone has their own limits and priorities.

4). Which recommendation from the video will you try out?

# 📕 Home assignment 42

## Task 1 Reading
### 1A
> [!NOTE]  
> *Read the text.*  

Setting personal boundaries is an important life skill. Boundaries are limits we set to protect our time, energy, and emotions. They help us feel safe and respected in relationships with others. Without clear boundaries, people might take advantage of us, even if they don’t mean to.  
One important boundary is learning to say "no." Many people find it difficult to say no because they don't want to hurt someone's feelings. However, saying yes to everything can make you feel stressed, tired, and even unhappy. Saying no is not rude; it shows self-respect and honesty.  
When setting boundaries, it’s important to communicate clearly. For example, if a friend asks you to help with something but you’re too busy, you can say, "I’d love to help, but I can’t right now." This way, you say no politely while showing understanding.  
Good boundaries also involve understanding your limits. Think about what is most important to you, like spending time with family, resting, or focusing on your work. When you know your priorities, it’s easier to protect them.  
Remember, setting boundaries is not about being selfish; it’s about taking care of yourself so you can be there for others in a healthy way.
