## Task 2. Vocabulary
> [!NOTE]  
> *Read a paragraph below and answer a few questions afterwards.*  

I often struggle with saying "no" because I worry that it might seem **selfish**. It's become a **habit** to always say "yes" to requests, even when I have a lot of things to do. Sometimes, I need to **step aside** and think about my own needs. When someone asks for a favour, I find it challenging to **get back** to them with a "no". I feel like I need an **excuse** to say "no", because I fear that their feelings will be **crushed**.

1. What can you recommend the person?
2. DEFINE all the words in the paragraph. Use an academic English dictionary if needed. (dictionary)
3.  Can you relate to the opinion in the paragraph? Do you often feel the same?

> I would recommend practicing setting healthy boundaries by learning that saying “no” isn’t selfish — it’s a way to protect your time, energy, and well-being. You can start with polite refusals like, “I’d love to help, but I’m currently at capacity.” Also, remind yourself that saying "no" doesn't require a detailed excuse — being honest and respectful is enough.
