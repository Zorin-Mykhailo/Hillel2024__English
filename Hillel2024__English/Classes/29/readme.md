## Task 1. Discussion

Discuss.

- Do you believe people can feel each other's pain or share thoughts without speaking? Why or why not?   
- Have you  heard about mysterious connections between family members or close friends?  

---

## Task 2. Reading and Grammar
### 2A. Prediction
*You're going to read a text about twin sisters and their mysterious connection. Look at the words below and try to predict what the text is going to be about.*   

 `share experience`    `feelings`    `no speaking`     `walk in town`     `her ankle was hurting`  
       `why`     `interesting video`    `send the link`     `was thinking to do the same`

---

### 2B
*Read the text, study the highlighted words and underlined phrases of reported speech.*  

SHARING THE PAIN  
Beth and her twin sister Harriet are convinced that they are able to share experiences and  feelings  without seeing or speaking to each other. Here's what Beth says:  'One day I was walking in town with Harriet. She told me that her right ankle[<sup>🌍</sup>](# "ankle [анкл] — щиколотка, кісточка (гомілковостопний суглоб)") `was hurting`, but `didn't know` why. She said she `hadn't twisted it` or anything, but told me she `couldn't put` any weight on it. About a minute later, I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my right ankle! On another occasion, I told Harriet that I `had watched` a really good video clip on the Internet the day before. I said that I `would send` her a link to the website where <u>I'd found it</u>. I told her <u>she must watch it</u>. Imagine my surprise when she said she had come across the same clip at the same time. She said that after <u>she'd finished watching it</u>, she had thought about sending me the link.

## 2C Reported speech. Grammar table
*Look at the text again. What are the speakers' original words? Complete the table with the correct tenses for the direct speech.*

| DIRECT SPEECH | REPORTED SPEECH |
| --- | --- |
| present simple | past simple |
| present continuous | past continuous |
| past simple | past perfect |
| past perfect | past perfect |
| present perfect | past perfect |
| can/can't | could/coudn't  |
| will/won't | would/wouldn't  |
| must | had to |

Study the rest of the rules.

REPORTED SPEECH
 
a). These verbs do not usually change in reported speech: *might, should, could, would, would like*.  
b). The past perfect does not change in reported speech. *"I'd never been there". She said she'd never been there*.    
c). We always use a personal object with *tell*. With *say*, we do not need a personal object. *I told John that I'd phone. I said (to Jo) that I'd phone*.   
d). We often omit "that" in reported speech. *He said he'd call you.*  

- Work with a partner. Find the examples of rules a-d in the text.

> NOTE!  
> Pronouns, possessive[<sup>🌍</sup>](# "possessive [позесів] — власницький, присвійний") adjectives and references of time and place usually change in reported speech.  
> "I'll phone you tomorrow", he said to me.  
> "He told me he'd phone me the following day  

| from | to |
| --- | --- |
| now -> | then/at that moment  |
| today ->| that day |
| an hour ago -> | an hour earlier |
| yesterday-> | the day before |
| last Tuesday/month/year-> | the Tuesday/the month/the year before |

> Yeah, and what about the others?

> So I said that I had washed the car the week before, but that seemed to make her angrier because I forgot that she'd paid me to do that.
