> This summer, Aperol Spritz has been flowing from the counters of the most wonderful places in New York city. In Paris, it's now a buzz at most cafes next to the local drinks and dishes.  
> Venetian aperitive was recently voted Italy's favourite pre-dinner drink. It is so popular that Italian minister Eugenia Roccella said that this drink is responsible for a population crisis saying that young couples now choose between "Drinking Spritz and having kids".  
> The original Spritz wasn't orange though. Its history goes back to the 18th century when Austria occupied vVenice int 1797  and ruled it for decades; the Austrians had no taste for the heavy Veeenetian wine, Malvasia, and imported their tradition of "Spritzen", adding a splash of sparkling water to a glass of white wine.  
> Aperol was invented in the nearby city of Padova in 1919 by brothers Luigi and Silvio Barbieri after sever years of experiments. It was first advertised in the 1920s to drinkers who wanted to stay fir because of its low alcohol level (11%), and to women in the 1930s with the slogan, "Signora! Aperol keeps you thin".  
> "Aperol Spritz was the drink of the old drunks, the ones at the bar who would say a curse every three words," explained Roberno Pasini, author of the 2013 pamphlet a guide to Spritz.  
> A universal crowd-pleaser, and much less alcoholic than Campari, Aperol introduced a taste for bitterness to people who didn't know they liked it yet, until about 40 years ago, Americans weren't open to bitter flavours. Now, people are googling questions like, "what the heck is vermouth?" or "what is red bitter liquor?", and more existential dilemmas like "can you drink Aperol by yourself?"  

- Do you think the popularity of alcohol can lead to decrease in population?
- Would you like to try the original Aperol that wasn't orange at all?
- Is it possible to be in shape, stay healthy and consume alcohol at the same time?
- What person do you imagine when you hear the word 'Aperol'?
- Do you prefer sweet, sour or bitter tastes?
