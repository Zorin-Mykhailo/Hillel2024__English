# Class 13. How are you really? 

## Task 1. Discussion 
### Discuss the questions in pairs.

1. How do you usually answer the question "How are you?"   
```
Typical responses might include: "I'm good," "I'm fine," or "Not bad."
Some people may add more detail if they know the person well or feel comfortable sharing.
``` 
2. Do you think people tell the truth when they answer this question? Why?  
```
Many people give automatic or polite answers (e.g., "I'm fine") without revealing their true feelings.
They may avoid sharing the truth because they don't want to burden others or think it's not the right time or place.
``` 
3. Do you think people who’re asking this question are really interested in it? Why?  
```
It depends on the context.
- Casual interactions: Often, it’s a formality or a polite social gesture.
- Close relationships: In deeper conversations, the person asking might genuinely care about the answer.

Cultural differences can also influence how genuinely this question is meant or received.
``` 

## Task 2. 
### Unscramble the answers to the most typical question: How are you?
1. `Good,` `thanks.` `And` `you?`
2. `I'm` `doing` `well.` `And` `you?`
3. `I'm` `doing` `all` `right.` `What` `about` `you?`
4. `Very` `well,` `thank` `you.`
5. `Alive` `and` `kicking.`
6. `Could` `be` `better.`

2. Oh man. I gotta be honest, things are coming to `fruition` for me. It's like finally, I'm in a better `state` mentaly, more calm.
3. I'm a bit all `over` the place. Some days are great, some not so much. But I try to do something that `brings` me joy every day.
4. I'm feeling so `hopeful` these days, just for the good things in life, you know.
5. Life's been a bit `stressful` lately, not gonna lie. `juggling` work and all is making me kind a `exhausted`.

`in a better state` — у кращому стані

* We use the present perfect continuous when we're more interested in the `action` than the `result` 
* With state verbs (be, know, see, feel, etc.), we use `present perfect`
