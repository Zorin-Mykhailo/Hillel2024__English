##  Task 4. Reading
### 4A 
*Read the article and answer the questions.*

1). What is the Gallup World Poll?  
2). How large is it?  
3). What are five aspects of life that the poll asks about?  
4). What are the main reasons for unhappiness according to the poll?   

**Imagine a ladder with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. If the top step of the ladder is the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder is the worst possible life for you, what step of the ladder do you think you are on?**

Over recent years, it has often been argued that it would be better to measure a country’s progress not simply in terms of wealth, but by thinking about what an economy should provide: good quality of life and happiness. The Gallup World Poll tries to measure this. The survey is done in over 160 nations and asks around 1,000 people in each country questions such as the one above.

Similar questions are asked about the situation of the country in general and about how those interviewed see their own lives in the past, present and future. The poll also has a wide variety of other questions which explore people’s feelings about life. The questions not only ask about finance, but also cover mental and physical health, how strong people’s local community is, social experiences and people’s purpose in life.

In explaining why they are unhappy with their lives, people do sometimes say they wish they had a higher income[<sup>🌍</sup>](# "income [інкам] — дохід, прибуток") or that they could afford[<sup>🌍</sup>](# "afford [афорд] — дозволити собі (фінансово чи в інший спосіб)") a car. However, more often the reasons are not to do with money: mostly people complain[<sup>🌍</sup>](# "complain [комплейн] — скаржитися, нарікати") about the environment they live in, lack of time with family and friends or anxiety[<sup>🌍</sup>](# "anxiety [енґзаєті] — тривога, неспокій") and depression. The results of the survey suggest that societies might be better dealing with these reasons for unhappiness rather than only trying to increase wealth[<sup>🌍</sup>](# "wealth [велθ] — багатство, достаток") and wages[<sup>🌍</sup>](# "wages [вейджиз] — заробітна плата (погодинна, денна або тижнева)"). The results may also explain why Costa Rica is much happier than richer countries like the US and Singapore.

---

### 4B 
*Choose the best conclusion for the article.*

a). The government shouldn't try to increase wealth.  
b). ✔ It's essential to improve people's environment and reduce working hours and stress levels.  
c). Poorer people are usually happier than rich people.  

---

### 4C. Reflection
*Answer the questions.*

- What's your opinion of the article?
- Have you ever been in a poor country and had the same feeling that people there were much happier? Tell about it to your partner.

**PATTERNS AFTER WISH**

2). Use I wish + <u>COULD</u> to say what you want to be able to do now.

# 📕 Home assignment 28

## Task 1. Reading
*Read the text and write true or false.* 

Happiness in the modern world often seems like a hard thing to find. With busy lives and so much screen time, people are feeling more stressed. It sometimes feels like everyone is on a fast track to get somewhere. Work and school demand a lot of our attention, leaving less time to relax or do things we love. People sometimes compare their lives to others on social media, which can make them feel like they are not doing well. This pressure to be perfect can make happiness seem out of reach.

Despite these challenges, people are finding new ways to be happy. Many have started practicing mindfulness and meditation. These practices help people focus on the present and find joy in simple things, like a beautiful sunset or a good meal. Others find happiness by spending time with loved ones, sharing experiences, and creating memories. Being with friends and family can offer support and remind us of what truly matters in life. People are also learning to switch off their devices more often to enjoy real-life interactions and experiences.

Happiness is not about having a perfect life but enjoying the moments we have. It is important to remember that while the modern world comes with its challenges, it also offers many opportunities to find joy. Whether it's through a hobby, time in nature, or a chat with a friend, happiness is within reach if we know where to look. The key is to appreciate what we have and make time for the things and people that bring us joy.


1). Many people feel more relaxed due to their busy lives and screen time.   
> false   

2). Social media comparisons often make people feel successful and happy.  
> false  

3). Practicing mindfulness can help individuals enjoy simple pleasures.  
> true 

4). Spending time with friends and family can provide emotional support.  
> true 

5). Happiness is about having a perfect life without any challenges.  
> false 

6). People are encouraged to disconnect from their devices to enhance real-life experiences.  
> true

Latin Americans value education, North Americans focus on life satisfaction, and Europeans prioritize health and the environment. Safety is key in Asia-Pacific, while Australians worry about work-life balance. Men prioritize income, women value community, and older people focus on health and civic engagement. The index helps governments create better policies based on people's needs.
