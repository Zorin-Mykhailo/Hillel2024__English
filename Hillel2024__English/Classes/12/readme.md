You're discussing the benefits of living in a farm house.  
Use such phrases as:  
`As far as I'm concerned`, `I'm convinced/certain that`, `Don't you think...?`, `Acording to some people`
```
You:
"As far as I'm concerned, living in a farmhouse is incredibly peaceful and relaxing. The fresh air and open spaces are perfect for escaping the hustle and bustle of city life."

Your Friend:
"That’s true! But don’t you think it might get a bit lonely being so far from neighbors or shops?"

You:
"Maybe, but I’m convinced that the connection with nature and the slower pace of life outweigh any downsides. Plus, you can grow your own food and enjoy a healthier lifestyle."

Your Friend:
"Good point! According to some people, living on a farm is also great for raising kids—they get to play outside and learn about animals and plants."

You:
"Exactly! I’m certain that it’s a fantastic way to teach responsibility and appreciation for the environment. And don’t you think it’s nice to have so much space for hobbies, like gardening or keeping animals?"
```

You're talking about your experiences living in a houseboat or a semi-detached house.  
Use such phrases as:  
`has been a bit of a challenge`, `I'm keen on`, `I'm useless at`, `I'm no expert`  
```
--- Talking About a Houseboat Experience:

You:
"Living on a houseboat has been a bit of a challenge, especially when it comes to managing space and dealing with maintenance issues."

Friend:
"That sounds tough. But it must have been exciting too, right?"

You:
"Absolutely! I'm keen on being close to nature, and waking up to the sound of water every day is amazing. It feels like you're on a permanent holiday."

Friend:
"Sounds lovely! But I imagine some things might not be so easy."

You:
"Yeah, you're right. I'm useless at fixing mechanical things, so dealing with the boat’s engine was a nightmare! And to be honest, I'm no expert at navigation either, so moving it around was always a stressful event."

--- Talking About a Semi-Detached House Experience:

You:
"Living in a semi-detached house has been a bit of a challenge when it comes to noise. Sometimes you can hear everything from your neighbors."

Friend:
"That must be annoying! Did you find any solutions?"

You:
"Not really, but I'm keen on decorating and personalizing the space. Making the house feel cozy helped me focus less on the negatives."

Friend:
"True, a cozy home makes all the difference. What else did you enjoy?"

You:
"Well, I'm no expert at gardening, but having a shared backyard was a great way to start learning. Though I have to admit, I'm useless at keeping plants alive!"
```

You're debating whether living in a city or a farm house is better.  
Use Comparative and Superlative adjectives and such phrases as:  
`As far as I'm concerned`, `I'm convinced that`, `Personally`, `If you ask me...`
```
You (in favor of a farmhouse):
"As far as I'm concerned, living in a farmhouse is far more peaceful than living in a noisy city. The air is cleaner, and the lifestyle is healthier. You can grow your own food, which is definitely the best way to stay eco-friendly."

Your Friend (in favor of the city):
"That may be true, but cities are more convenient. Personally, I think having access to the best hospitals, schools, and entertainment makes city life better overall. Don’t forget, the job opportunities are also greater."

You:
"I see your point, but I’m convinced that living in a farmhouse offers the most relaxing lifestyle. It’s not just about health; it’s about mental well-being too. Being surrounded by nature is so much calmer than the constant rush of the city."

Your Friend:
"Fair enough, but if you ask me, the city is more exciting and provides a lot more opportunities for socializing and networking. Plus, you’re never bored because there’s always something to do."

You:
"That’s true, but if we’re talking about raising a family, I believe a farmhouse is safer and better for teaching kids about responsibility and nature. If you ask me, it’s the perfect place for a balanced childhood."
```

You're thinking of buying a mobile home and go travelling.  
Use such phrases as:  
`to have a go`, `try out new skills`, `houseboat`, `if you ask me`  
```
You:
"I’ve been thinking about buying a mobile home and going traveling. It seems like such a fun way to explore new places and have a go at living differently."

Friend:
"That sounds amazing! What’s making you consider it?"

You:
"Well, I’d love to try out new skills, like cooking in a tiny kitchen or learning how to maintain a vehicle like that. Plus, it feels so freeing to just hit the road whenever you want."

Friend:
"True, but wouldn’t a houseboat be even more adventurous? Imagine waking up on the water every day!"

You:
"That’s an interesting idea, but if you ask me, a mobile home is more practical. You can go anywhere—mountains, beaches, even cities—while a houseboat is limited to water. Besides, I’ve never been great at handling boats!"

## Task 4. Past Simple vs Present Perfect
PAST SIMPLE



PRESENT PERFECT

## Task 5. Modals of obligation, permission and possibility 

### 1. Answer the questions with your partner.

• What modal verbs  in the **present** do we use if something is necessary/obligatory ?  

| Modal Verb | Strength of Obligation | Source of Obligation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Must | Strong obligation, personal or moral | Internal (speaker's opinion) |
| Have to | Strong obligation | External (laws, rules, authority) |
| Need to | Medium to strong necessity | Practical necessity |

• What modal verb do we use in the past if something was necessary/obligatory?

`Must` ⚠️ does not have a direct past tense form. Instead, we use "had to" to express past obligations or necessities.  
`Had to` — To express past necessity or obligation. It is the past form of "have to."  
`Needed to` — To indicate a necessity or requirement in the past. It is the past form of "need to."  


• What modal verb do we use  if something is /isn't allowed or possible?

`Can` (Present) — To indicate that something is allowed or is possible.  
`Can't` (Present) — To indicate that something isn't allowed or isn't possible.  
`May` (Formal, Present) — To indicate formal permission or possibility.  
`May not` (Formal, Present) — To indicate that something isn't allowed in a formal or polite way.  
`Might` (Present or Future) — To indicate possibility (less certain than "may").  

| Modal Verb | Meaning | Examples |
| :--- |:--- | :--- |
| Can |Allowed/Possible | You can take photos here. (Ти можеш фотографувати тут.) |
| Can't | Not allowed/Not possible | You can't enter this room. (Тобі не можна входити до цієї кімнати.) |
| May | Formal permission/possibility | You may leave early today. (Ви можете піти раніше.) |
| May not | Formal prohibition | You may not bring food here. (Тобі не дозволено приносити їжу сюди.) |
| Might | Possibility (less certain) | He might join us later. (Він, можливо, приєднається до нас пізніше.) |

• What modals do we use  In the past if something wasn't necessary/obligatory ? 

`Didn't have to `— To indicate that something was not necessary in the past, but it could have been done if desired.  
`Didn't need to` — Similar to "didn't have to," meaning that there was no necessity to do something in the past.  
`Needn't have + past participle` — To express that something was done in the past but turned out to be unnecessary.
