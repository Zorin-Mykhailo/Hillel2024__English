**The Missing Phone**

Last night, during a birthday party at a friend's house, Emma's phone went missing. She had placed it on the kitchen table while she helped set up the decorations. When the party was in full swing, Emma realized her phone was gone. Three people were near the table around that time: Lucy, who was taking photos for Instagram; Jake, who was seen holding a similar phone earlier; and Mia, who quickly left the kitchen to answer a call. Who took Emma’s phone?

**The Broken Window**

On Saturday afternoon, a neighbor called the police to report a broken window at Mrs. Brown’s house. When Mrs. Brown arrived home, she found the window smashed and a soccer ball inside her living room. Outside, three children were playing: Alex, who said he was playing far from the house; Ben, who admitted he kicked the ball hard but claimed it wasn’t him; and Clara, who quickly left when the police arrived. Who broke the window?

**The Missing Necklace**

During a family dinner at a fancy restaurant, Aunt Clara noticed that her diamond necklace was missing. She remembered wearing it when they arrived, but it disappeared sometime during the evening. Three people were near her table: the waiter, who was very attentive and kept coming back to check on the table; her cousin Ella, who complimented the necklace earlier and asked to try it on; and her little nephew Tommy, who was playing under the table. Who took the necklace?
