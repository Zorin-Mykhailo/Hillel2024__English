2B   
🌊 You are going to read a text about a couple who had an amazing and very unusual travel experience.  
🌊 Look at the pictures and try to predict what the text is going to be about.  

Clive and Jane with Will - a face they created on the back of their compass if they wanted a change of company  
Their itinerary (plan of a journey)  
The couple's bedroom on their boat
The couple's living area on their boat  
Jane on a camel in Egypt  
The couple in New Zealand  
Jane at the Tanna Yasur Volcano  

---

2C • Discuss.

- Do you think this couple have been travelling for a short or long time? How short? How long?
- If they have been travelling for a long time, how could they afford that?
- Brainstorm some idea on where to get money for a long trip. Be creative.

---

2D • Read the text and check your ideas.

When Jane and Clive Green `stopped` working, they `decided` to go on a trip to Spain in their yacht. They `expected` to be away for about a week - but in the end, they `continued` travelling for sixteen years! After they reached Spain in their ten-metre yacht, they did not `fancy` returning home, so they `kept` sailing. After crossing the Atlantic, they `stopped` to explore the islands of the Caribbean for a while. Then they `continued` to sail west around the world. They `ended up` visiting 56 countries and sharing some amazing experiences. They particularly `enjoyed` swimming with seals near the Galapagos Islands. However, they `remember` feeling very anxious near Somalia because a boat would not `stop` following them and they had heard about psrates in that area. It was actually a fishing boat with an snjured man on board, so Jane `offered` to help him before they continued on their way. They `managed` to pay for their trip by selling their house back in the UR. Most of the time, they could `afford` to buy food, but they ran out lf money on an island near Fiji. Fortunately, a local woman `agreed` to give them a box of fruit and vegetables in exchange for some underwear!

---

2E • Answer the question.

If you were on that boat and were travelling like this, would you have liked that? Why? Why not?

> If I were on that boat, I think I would like it because it seems like a grand adventure.  
> I enjoy exploring new places and experiencing freedom at sea.  
> However, the challenges—like safety concerns and money troubles—might worry me. Overall, it's an exciting but risky journey.  

---

## Task 3. Grammar. Gerund/Infinitive  

> Read the rules. Look at the text again, pay attention to the highlighted words.

Learn this! Gerund vs Infinitive

a) Деякі дієслова вимагають використання інфінітиву іншого дієслова.

    > наприклад:  
    > Do you want `to go` out?  
    > Чи хочеш ти піти кудись?  
    >   
    > She hopes `to be` a teacher.  
    > Вона сподівається стати вчителем.  

b) Деякі дієслова вимагають використання форми з закінченням -ing (герундій) іншого дієслова.

    > наприклад:  
    > She always `avoids` paying.  
    > Вона завжди уникає оплати.  
    >   
    > I spend a lot of time `texting`.  
    > Я витрачаю багато часу на переписку.  

c) Деякі дієслова можуть використовувати як інфінітив, так і форму -ing без зміни значення.

    > наприклад:  
    > I like to cook.  
    > Мені подобається готувати.  
    >   
    > I like cooking.  
    > Мені подобається готування.  

d) Деякі дієслова змінюють своє значення залежно від того, чи слідують за ними -ing чи інфінітив.

    > наприклад:  
    > I didn't remember speaking to Jo. (*I forgot that I  had spoken to her*)   
    > Я забув, що говорив з Джо (*Я забув, що вже говорив з нею.*)  
    >   
    > I didn't remember to speak to Jo. (*I didn't speak to her*)  
    > Я не згадав поговорити з Джо. (*Я не говорив з нею.*)  

e) Дієслова `let` та `make` вимагають використання інфінітиву без частки to.  

    > наприклад:  
    > She let me drive.  
    > Вона дозволила мені керувати.  
    >   
    > I made her laugh.  
    > Я змусив її сміятися.
